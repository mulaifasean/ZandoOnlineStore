                    Zando offers you the following payment methods:

Payment via credit card

Zando accepts credit card and chipped debit/cheque card payment via Visa, MasterCard and America Express only. We make use of the 3D-Secure authentication system to verify cardholder details with your bank; this links you directly to your bank via a secure link. The transaction then takes place within your bank’s secure environment and we won’t have access to any of your card details. You can rest assured that your card details will by no means be available to, or accessible by, us or any third parties. When you return a purchase, the specified amount will be credited back to your bank account after it has been approved. Take note that only credit card payments are accepted in respect of Zando Deals orders.

EFT (electronic funds transfer)

This payment method requires the customer to transfer money directly from his/her account into Zando’s account, through computer-based systems.

If you select EFT, you will be redirected to our secure payment gateway and asked to select your bank. The details for the EFT payment will then be displayed, along with instructions regarding references etc.

All bank deposit EFT’s require proof of payment to be sent to service@zando.co.za before your order will be processed. If payment does not reflect for an EFT transaction we may request proof of payment to be sent before your order is processed.

Why should I use the EFT option? EFT is convenient in that it is not time consuming and it’s easy to use. Zando also creates a safe and trustworthy banking environment for the benefit of the customers and the company

Take note that only South African EFT payments will be accepted and no international bank electronic transfers are accepted. Furthermore, EFT payments will not be accepted in respect of Zando Deals orders.

COD (Cash on Delivery)

Pay for your purchase in cash when it is delivered to your door. This is an easy payment option that only requires you to have the correct amount of cash when your package is delivered, as our delivery men do not carry petty cash. Take note that all payment should be done in South African Rand, and that the COD option is only available for certain postal codes. Please note that a handling fee of R10 will be charged on checkout.

Should it so happen that you are not available to accept delivery you can postpone/delay delivery for a maximum of three (3) business days after the initial attempt to delivery. If delivery has not taken place within these three days, the order will be cancelled and returned to our warehouse.
